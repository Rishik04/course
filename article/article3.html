                    <p>
                        Whether in the present or the past, corruption has stayed with us like a part of society. Even
                        if you think of eradicating it, implementation on the real ground is very difficult because of
                        its deep roots in the system. This greed of money earning by misusing the position and power,
                        along with the situation and circumstances, has made corruption an ugly and undeniable fact in
                        our life. Since success and achievement requirement requires efforts and hard work, not everyone
                        out there wants to opt this road and eventually turns to the road of corruption which has now
                        spread to the different paths such as social, political, and economic, which are the base
                        grounds of any society.

                    <h4 style="color:black;">SOCIAL EVIL</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        If you start looking at the traces, you will see the first trace in the ancient times where the
                        people of low castes, based on the varna system, who had money and muscle power in them, bribed
                        the Bhramanas and changed their castes to a noble one. If you move on to the medieval time, you
                        will see the Mughal system where the zamindars used to force the poor and powerless to give more
                        tax in order to get income and jobs. If you want to find traces in the British Period, you will
                        get the whole impressions where the workers were forced to live where they did plantation and
                        had to give 50-80 percent of their produce in order to get the remaining portion. And in the
                        present time, you will see the powerful taking bribes to complete the legit works and procedures
                        of poor and powerless.
                    </p>

                    <h4 style="color:black;">POLITICAL EVIL</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Even if the political evil is not having a face officially, it is still known to everybody. The
                        huge misallocation of resources as well as the discrepancies in the decision making gets
                        included in the political evil. Earlier in British times, the English East India Company bribed
                        the Nawab of Bengal to let them continue their work without tax which was a form of corruption.
                        In the present scenario also, the decisions are amended if one of the two rivals are powerful
                        enough and have money and muscle power in their hands.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="color:black;">ECONOMIC EVIL</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The economic variables of corruption are indeed debatable. According to one view, there is a
                        negative relationship between economic growth and the level of corruption. An unpredictable
                        corruption leads to situations of bribery which damages the economy. Poor service and facility
                        is provided due to an increased amount of corruption. The roots of economic corruption are so
                        widespread that it has got interconnected with all the other paths and sectors. If earlier,
                        there was corruption under the barter system, then now the evil is under the cash flow system
                        which is divided into two broad streams – black money and white money.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="color:black;">CONCLUSION</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Thus, it is not easy to eradicate corruption from a country. Even though it seems visible, but
                        there is a whole board with a complex structure under the shade which is very time-taking to
                        remove. To be precise, it has become the second half of a system without which everything seems
                        to be inoperative.
