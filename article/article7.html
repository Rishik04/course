                    <h4 style="color:black;">5 TIPS TO LEARN DIFFICULT TOPICS EASILY</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        1. Baby steps<br>
                        2. Practice makes a man perfect<br>
                        3. 3R’s secret<br>
                        4. The root is bitter but the fruit is sweet<br>
                        5. Hard work + Smart Work = achievement<br>
                        <br>
                        The initial question that comes to a student’s mind while he/she is frustrated is that why the learning procedure is so problematic? To answer this question, let us look at one prominent Bengali saying which says that ‘Nobody learns to walk without rough falls’. In simpler words, it means that one should be ready to suffer the pain at first to get the results later. But has anyone told you that you should prefer a path that concentrates more on results rather than anguish? Let us go through some of the strategies to pursue this road.

                    <h4 style="color:black;">1. Learn the Baby steps</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The baby steps strategy is the first and foremost to memorize the difficult topics easily. Instead of learning the chapter as a whole, slice it into various parts, and take one topic at a time. If you want to learn the tough topics easily, you need to make sure that ‘Slow and Steady Wins the race’. So, master level 1 in order to reach level 2 and attain victory in no time.    
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="color:black;">2. Practice makes a man perfect</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        A rather old but popular and effective saying it is indeed! The practice is the only thing that helps you to win in any circumstances. For instance, to win a game of chess, you need to learn the moves and strategies to defeat the opponent. How do you think they memorize it? Yes, through practice. Investment of time in practice is definitely going to be the trick which will be your master ingredient of fast learning.

                    <h4 style="color:black;">3. Learning Mantra: 3R’s secret</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        You must have always heard about the 3R policy of Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle in your environmental education subject. But what key supplement in your journey, which you were aware of till now, is the 3R policy of learning. The 3R policy of learning stands for reading, Recite and Record. It means that to learn a particular topic, you need to read the topic with focus as a first step. After that, you need to recite what you have understood from that topic. And the third and final step is to Record your understanding by writing either in the notes format or the practice format.

                    <h4 style="color:black;">4. The root is bitter but the fruit is sweet</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The heading suggests that if you want to learn, you need to burn your midnight oil at the beginning which is a must to go process. Once you pass this phase, you will get the results as you have always desired. It is similar to the situation where a farmer works hard to grow its crops and get sweet results at the time of harvesting.
                    
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="color:black;">5. Hard work + Smart Work = achievement</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Most people recommend the students that you need to do hard work to achieve success. But we ask you why hard work and not the smart one? We do not deny the significance of hard work but we need to comprehend that time waits for none. So, striving hard with smart study is the key to achievement. In other words, invest your time as hard work and memorize the topics through an adequate strategy which is the successive path to achievement.
