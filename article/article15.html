                    <p>
                        “If you are not willing to learn, no one can help you. If you are determined to learn, no one can stop you” said Zig Ziglar.<br>
                        If every individual is filled with a passionate wish to learn and a fervent longing for learning, how the world would have changed. Have you ever thought of this? What a great outcome it would have brought universally?<br>
                        Unlike the age old days, we are blessed with several pathways to success; opportunities at our doorstep; to our great amazement, the entire world, close at hand.<br>
                        Information can be found in every nook and corner, the only thing is that we must have our eyes and minds widely opened to recognize and realize them; and finally imbibe it to the fullest so as to quench our thirst for knowledge.<br>
                        E-learning is Lifelong Learning<br>
                        What is e-learning, actually? It is a lifelong learning system conducted through electronic media and is considered the most resourceful mode of delivering courses online. The availability of study resources anywhere and at any time makes it suitable and flexible. A full time student and employee can utilise their leisure time with the aid of web-based learning. As far as the technologically advanced age is concerned, lifelong learning has become the ultimate goal of educational as well as employment sectors. It keeps us well-informed and well-exercised and boosts our CV and future prospects. This promotes the credentials of labor force and equips them with precise information and improved expertise.<br>
                        E-learning, a Global Tie-up<br>
                        In every sector of our life, globalization has made an astounding effect. Being influenced thus, education has ensued to significant advances like shift from instructor-centered to learner-centered form, development of new curricula, proposal of new syllabi and mainly e-learning. The involvement of international Universities makes the reform quite effective and challenging. A new transformation worldwide thus happened.<br>
                        In a completely vigorous online platform, by effectively integrating technology for learning you will have flexible time for learning and flexible deadlines too. Instructors can allow people to partake and complete tasks at a range of times through media, email or other word-based formats.<br>
                        You have the global teaching and learning community at your fingertips. Though the educators and learners are behind the monitors, human connections and expressive communications are an indispensible part of online learning process. Thus, methods are developed to interact with instructors and learners from different countries. Thereby you get exposed to various cultures, traditions and above all numerous perspectives and impressive ideas.<br>
                        Scholars are given the space to get connected and thus they can collaborate and engage in well-appreciated peer-to-peer learning occasions. This can be conducted through online discussion forum. Even in the absence of teachers social media platforms make students capable of interacting and sharing information with each other. Thus, crowds learn and teach in networked online environments.<br>
                        With social media build networks worldwide; stay home, get enriched with a ton of information and remain globally connected. <br>
