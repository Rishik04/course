                    <h4 style="color: black;">The Secret Sauce</h4>
                    <p>
                        The credo “We become what we think about” has mesmerised billions of souls all over the universe. The genius behind the brainstorming secret is Earl Nightingale, an American radio speaker and author, who has left an astounding legacy of perceptions on life and leadership. As a young boy he was questing after “How can a person, starting from scratch, who has no particular advantage in the world, reach the goals that he feels are important to him, and, by so doing, make a major contribution to others?” Ultimately, his life became one of the world’s prominent success stories capable of stimulating folks to reach their uppermost possibilities.<br>
                        Your Mindset Matters<br>
                        Thomas Alva Edison, a genius inventor, came up with the best definition of a genius: “Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration” and Nightingale’s life upholds the statement. Not only Nightingale, but such is the life of every luminary. It is not that they never confronted impediments in life time, but as they were willing to perspire to become geniuses, they always rebounded from the ashes with extra strength and zeal and became legendary masterminds touching the heart of hearts. Thus, when the ‘want’ gets stronger and you are capable of asking and answering enough ‘whys’, the ‘how’ gets easier; this excavates a smarter path for the genius, who all the time yearns to strike out an innovative pathway.<br>
                        “Life is really simple, but we insist in making it complicated”, said Confucius and at all times we take success too, intricate. In reality, though a bit tough, reaching new heights is not an impossible task; instead, it originates from the steady run-through of simple essentials. Alongside, it’s truly imperative to keep in mind what Napolean Hill has wisely said, “A winner never quits, and a quitter never wins.” If you really want to accomplish eminence in your life you will have to put in determination to the full.<br>
                        The Miracle Procedure<br>
                        The mostly held sure-fire way to become a genius is to figure out what you want, set real goals and create a coherent strategy to attain them. To be justly outstanding, one needs to put in tremendous effort of energy besides being super-smart and smart working. Setting up proper priorities, plan and organise your activities and always be prepared with a to-do list. Continuous learning is mandatory for every individual as Jim Rohn has said, “Learning is the beginning of wealth. Learning is the beginning of health. Learning is the beginning of spirituality. Searching and learning is where the miracle process all begins”; the miracle of becoming a genius.<br>
                        Trust in your ability to get ahead and permanently focus on getting heightened in every aspect of your target. It is psychologically proven that nothing pedals our existence more than our self-image and so, surround yourself with positivity. It’s indeed important to make yourself action-oriented. Seize every single moment to act on your objectives, regularly monitoring the progress you make. Greatness can be attained by spending a lot of time perfecting it as Aristotle commented, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.”<br>
                        In “The Road not Taken” Robert Frost has said, “Two roads diverged in the wood, and I – I took the one less travelled by, and that has made all the difference”. To showcase you brilliance, dare to be different perceiving that each and every new adventure has an inherent risk and one should always be passionate and audacious enough to tear down the brick walls to welcome prodigious opportunities. Exploring novel ideas and thereby challenging yourself and your mind, keep your brain well exercised. When enthusiasm and expertise come together, we are often left with a masterpiece and thus a genius is born.<br>
                        “Champions aren’t made in gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside them: a desire, a dream and a vision. They have to have the skill and the will. But the will must be stronger than the skill.” - Muhammad Ali<br>
