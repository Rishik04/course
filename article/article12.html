                    <p>
                        To well explain the truth that the secret behind every single success is a strong purpose, its really interesting to see how Socrates’ gave insight to a young man who approached him to find the key to success. Both Socrates and the young man met at a river and as instructed by the former, they walked into it. When they reached the middle, Socrates ducked the man into the water and kept him submerged for quite some time. After pulling him out, Socrates asked the man: “What did you want the most when your head was underwater?” He replied: “Air”, to which Socrates said: “That is the secret to success. When you want success as badly as you wanted the air, then you will get it. There is no other secret.”<br>
                        Your Mind is Endless<br>
                        Besides extreme enthusiasm to attain success, memory power performs a crucial role. Each and every person is aware of the fact that a fantastic memory can make a tremendous difference in their lives; it could even better the opportunities that lie ahead. Michael J Gelb rightly said, “Your brain has a capacity for learning that is virtually limitless, which makes every human a potential genius”.<br>
                        But, in reality, what happens is that we fail to recognize that no supercomputers in the digital age can match the efficient performance of a wholesome human brain and thus we go on battling with a handicap, just making unreasonable justifications. But, as our minds have an infinite ability, little hard work and persistence can develop this particular faculty to the full.<br>

                    <h4 style="color:black;">Hints and Tips</h4>
                    <p>
                        For centuries, bragging about poor memory, man has been trying out several means to keep up an accurate memory. Many methods arose throughout and proved successful. First of all, psychology has attributed three stages to memory: memories are formed through the process of ‘encoding’, held through ‘storage’, and recollected through ‘retrieval’. To prevent memory decay and boost up long-term memory, one is supposed to practice and relearn the traffic of information that floods in the brain after getting through all the above-mentioned stages. Here are some tips and tricks you can implement regularly, to sharpen your recall system.<br>
                        1. “The force of passion is balanced by the force of interest”, stated Jose Marti. It is absolutely significant for the learners to enrich a keen interest in their subjects of study so as to make the task of memorizing easier.<br>
                        2. The key points to be engraved in mind are to develop a strong sense of powerful observation and careful selection. One should always possess an eye for detail to capture every essential information and junk the superfluous data.<br>
                        3. You can recall any novel idea if you associate it with something you are familiar with or you are extremely curious about. You can also use colorful and pleasant images to correlate sections or make ACRONYMS. Group similar concepts.<br>
                        4. To connect a list of seemingly distinct objects or places, you can weave a simple story.<br>
                        5. “Good order is the foundation of all things”, said Edmund Burke. Likewise, always be careful enough to learn everything in a well-organized manner.<br>
                        6. Be coherent with every fact (avoiding tough words), making it as simple as possible because it would lessen your burden while revising the portions just hours before your examination.<br>
                        7. Reading aloud your topics of study would enhance your mental ability through the sense of hearing.<br>
                        8. Never imagine that everything you have learned remains intact in your brain unless you find time to review the portions without delay. Keep in mind to concentrate on areas you find more hard to remember.<br>
                        9. Steve Brunkhorst said, “The more often you share what you have learned, the stronger that information will become in your memory”. Visualize yourself teaching the material.<br>
                        10. Never forget that health matters the most; so have healthy food and sound sleep. Basic meditation helps you improve your concentration.
                        Stick on to the techniques of your choice and make winning a habit, and as Ralph Waldo Emerson has said, “Once you make a decision, the universe conspires to make it happen<br>
